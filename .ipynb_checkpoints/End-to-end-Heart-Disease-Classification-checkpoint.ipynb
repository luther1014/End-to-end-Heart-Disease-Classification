    "# Predicting Heart disease using Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook looks into various python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machin learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to take the following approach:\n",
    "1. Problem definition\n",
    "2. Data\n",
    "3. Evaluation\n",
    "4. Features\n",
    "5. Modelling\n",
    "6. Experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "> Given the clinical parameters of a patient can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The Original data came form the UCI Machine learning repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a version of it available on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "> If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, then we'll pursue the project\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Features\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you'll get information about each of the features in your data. You can do this via doing your own research (such as looking at the links above) or by talking to a subject matter expert (someone who knows about the dataset).\n",
